# Frontend Design Standards — GlobalHighLevel.com

## Brand & Audience
- Site: GlobalHighLevel.com — free GoHighLevel tutorials and affiliate site
- Audience: Digital marketing agency owners, freelancers, business owners
- Tone: Confident expert talking to a peer. Not a salesperson. Not a blogger.
- Goal: Affiliate signups for GHL 30-day free trial

## Design Rules — Non-Negotiable

### NO generic AI aesthetics:
- No purple/violet gradients
- No Inter or Roboto as the primary display font
- No "glassmorphism" cards with blur effects
- No generic blue (#3b82f6) as the accent
- No grid-of-3-feature-cards with emoji icons as the only layout idea

### DO use distinctive choices:
- Pick ONE unexpected accent color (amber, coral, lime, copper — not blue, not purple)
- Use DM Sans 800 for headlines (loaded via Google Fonts)
- DM Sans for body copy — clean and readable
- Asymmetric layouts, pull-quotes, editorial treatments
- CSS animations: entrance fades, scroll reveals (CSS only, no JS deps)
- Generous whitespace — let the content breathe

### Typography hierarchy:
- Headlines: DM Sans 800, clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3.5rem), line-height 1.15, letter-spacing -.5px
- Section headlines: DM Sans 800, 1.5rem
- Body: 19px, DM Sans 400, line-height 1.75
- Labels/eyebrows: 13px, uppercase, letter-spacing .5px

### Color palette:
- Background: Near-black (#07080a)
- Surface cards: #111520
- Accent: Amber (#f59e0b) or another non-generic choice — decide before building
- Text: #eef2ff (primary), #7c8aab (secondary), #3d4a63 (muted)
- Do NOT use blue as the primary accent

## Affiliate Link Rules — NEVER Break These

- **Every single link to GoHighLevel.com MUST use the affiliate link** — no exceptions
- Affiliate link: `https://www.gohighlevel.com/highlevel-bootcamp?fp_ref=amplifi-technologies12`
- Always append UTM params: `&utm_source=globalhighlevel&utm_medium={location}&utm_campaign={context}`
- This includes: pricing pages, feature pages, sign-up pages, help links — ANYTHING on gohighlevel.com
- NEVER link to `gohighlevel.com/pricing` or any GHL URL without `fp_ref=amplifi-technologies12`
- All affiliate links: `target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"`
- **No placeholder `#` links** — if the real URL isn't known, link to `/category/gohighlevel-tutorials/` or `/`
- Spotify podcast link: `https://open.spotify.com/show/28LLaXVbmnHUMNBFGdgdlV`

## /trial/, /coupon/, /start/ — Attribution URLs (NOT SEO landings)

**Purpose:** These three paths are dedicated attribution/conversion pages for people who arrive from our owned media (podcast descriptions, blog CTAs, social). They are intentionally separated from organic SEO pages.

**What they are:**
- **`/trial/`** — podcast-description destination. Every episode description on Spotify/Apple points here.
- **`/coupon/`** — promo-code / discount-hunter destination (also podcast + social use).
- **`/start/`** — blog-article-embedded CTA destination (split from `/trial/` on 2026-04-15 for attribution).

**Format (all three):**
- Full content pages, ~1,500–2,000 words each
- Pitch BOTH GHL primary affiliate AND Extendly secondary affiliate (education + trust before the click)
- 7+ outbound affiliate links with `fp_ref=amplifi-technologies12` + UTM params
- GA4 fires `cta_click` / `affiliate_click` event on every CTA press (before the outbound redirect)
- Peter Attia voice: teach the "why 30 days not 14", who it's for, what's included, then affiliate

**Why they're `Disallow`'d in `robots.txt`:**
- Normal Googlebot is explicitly blocked from crawling these paths
- AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended, PerplexityBot, anthropic-ai) ARE allowed
- Reason: keep attribution clean — these URLs must NOT compete in SERPs with our organic blog pages, otherwise podcast-click data is polluted with organic-search clicks

**Locked for 8 weeks** (historical: was enforced via `locked_until` in the retired pipeline's `seo-cooldown.json`; the SEO optimizer that read it is gone as of 2026-06-11, so this lock is no longer auto-enforced — keep the paths out of SERP competition manually).

**Parallel SEO-indexable pages exist** for trial + pricing (these rank for organic money keywords):
- `/trial/` ↔ `/blog/gohighlevel-free-trial-30-days-extended/`
- `/blog/gohighlevel-pricing-plans-2026-complete-guide/` for the pricing query cluster

`/coupon/` does NOT have a parallel SEO blog. Per Apr 21 redesign (commit `3788bf1`): the old `/blog/gohighlevel-promo-code-discount-2026-real-ways-to-save/` was deleted and `_redirects:18` 301s any inbound traffic to `/blog/gohighlevel-free-trial-30-days-extended/` (the trial blog is the canonical SEO destination for both trial and discount intent — they consolidated). Auto-deploy `aa23952` accidentally re-added the promo blog on the cliff day; cleaned up again 2026-05-07 in commit `3f8588e`.

The attribution URLs (`/trial/`, `/coupon/`, `/start/`) and the SEO blog are allowed to have overlapping content — different audiences, different funnels, different attribution. Edit them independently.

**Do NOT:**
- Unblock `/trial/`, `/coupon/`, or `/start/` in `robots.txt` — it breaks attribution
- Migrate their content to the blog pages — kills podcast-listener UX and the Extendly pitch
- Thin them out to a fast redirect — loses the "teach before you sell" voice and Extendly conversion
- Point internal cross-links to these paths for SEO reasons — always link to the `/blog/...` SEO page for content context, reserve attribution paths for owned-media CTAs only

**When editing:** if you rewrite one, consider whether the parallel SEO blog post needs the same update (e.g., new FAQ entry, updated pricing). They're independent artifacts serving different audiences, but fact drift between them is confusing.
